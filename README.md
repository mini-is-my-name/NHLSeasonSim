This script pulls Elo data from my personal Google Sheet that contains my own Elo rankings for each NHL team.
        The code I used to pull this data is not mine, I merely adapted it. I can not find where I sourced it, so if you recognize it as yours, please let me know.

Using the Elo data, win chances for each team is calculated for each remaining game of the season and a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to give playoff percentages and cup odds.

I wrote the playoff simulation code at work on a slow day without access to the remaining code, so there may be some redundancies there.

Code can probably be adapted if you have your own way to calculate win chances for each game. If you choose to do this, feel free to use my code as long as you credit me.
